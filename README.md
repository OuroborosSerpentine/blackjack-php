# Blackjack-php
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mykisscool/blackjack-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mykisscool/blackjack-php)

This is a simple player vs computer Blackjack game.  It was created using **only** OO PHP and basic HTML & CSS. No Laravel. No jQuery. No PhpStorm. No Blackjack experience, either. The inspiration for this project was a recent coding challenge that I participated in.

## Roadmap

1. Find a better way to handle running out of cards in the middle of a hand.
2. Allow the user to decide if an Ace should be valued at a 1 or an 11.  Right now, the hand score is calculated automatically to maximize hand value and avoid a bust.
3. Implement split and double-up features.
4. Implement betting.
5. Take over Las Vegas.
