# Blackjack-php

This is a simple player vs computer Blackjack game.  It was created using **only** OO PHP and basic HTML & CSS. No Laravel. No jQuery. No PhpStorm. No Blackjack experience, either. The inspiration for this project was a recent coding challenge that I participated in.

## Roadmap

1. Allow betting
2. Implement split and double-up features.
3. Allow the user to decide if an Ace should be valued at a 1 or an 11.  Right now, the hand score is calculated (after-the-fact) to maximize hand value and avoid a bust.
4. Find a better way to handle running out of cards in the middle of a hand.
5. Take over Las Vegas.
